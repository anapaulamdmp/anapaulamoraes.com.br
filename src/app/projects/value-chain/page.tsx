            Banco do Brasil is the <b>oldest and one of the biggest financial institutions in Latin America</b> and tracks economic activity relationships through a dataset extracted from CNAE (National Classification of Economic Activities) database. However, visualizing and interpreting this data proved challenging due to its complexity.

        <p className="text-slate-950 mb-4">
            Banco do Brasil&apos;s Value Chain was created to <b>capture the audience&apos;s attention by showcasing innovation and simplifying complex data. </b>With the goal of bringing the project to the broader public through technology and innovation conferences, the platform uses advanced visual tools to transform intricate financial data into an easily understandable and interactive experience. By organizing data based on the CNAE, it allows users to explore connections between sectors like agribusiness, education, and healthcare, making complex economic relationships more accessible and engaging.
